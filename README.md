# Tic Tac Toe

![Design Preview](preview.jpg)

## Hello!

This is my Tic Tac Toe game website, where you will be able to:

- Play with a friend (using the same device, at least for now)
- Play with my algorithm (can you beat it?)

Many thanks to [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) for this [coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v) and the very beautiful design.

## Run Yourself

> Make sure you have Git (or GitHub CLI) and NodeJS installed before continue. See [how to install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [how to install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) if you need to.

Run the following commands to see this application on your own machine:

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dcdm3g/tic-tac-toe

# Go to the created folder
cd tic-tac-toe

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start the NextJS development server
pnpm dev
```

Great! The NextJS development server should start at http://localhost:3000. See the [NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) if you need to.
